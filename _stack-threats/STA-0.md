    PossibleCountermeasures:
        "To reduce the risk to enterprise resources being accessed from vulnerable devices, deploy EMM/MDM solutions that can successfully enforce policies to monitor the OS version of devices and block enterprise connectivity from out-of-date devices or those with known-exploitable privilege escalation vulnerabilities.":
            - Enterprise
        "To help reduce the latency between exploit notification and patch availability, purchase devices from vendors/carriers who have committed to providing timely updates or who have known track records for prompt updates.":
            - Enterprise
        "To help reduce the opportunity for attack following availability of patches, configure automatic installation of, or, at a minimum, automatic notification of the availability of mobile OS security updates.":
            - Enterprise    
            - Mobile Device User
        "Use tools or device APIs (Android SafetyNet, Samsung Knox hardware-backed remote attestation, or other applicable remote attestation technologies) to detect and block enterprise connectivity from devices that fail attestation or integrity checks.":
            - Enterprise
        "Disable components with known vulnerabilities (e.g. disable MMS, Bluetooth, etc.) until the vulnerability is patched to prevent exploitation.":
            - Enterprise
